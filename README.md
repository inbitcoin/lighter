# Lighter - The Lightning Network Wrapper

Lighter provides a uniform interface to the main LN implementations,
allowing client code to be agnostic on which node is running under the hood
and therefore focus on functionality.

The purpose of the project is to allow developers of LApps to code in peace
with no bond to any particular implementation.

Lighter exposes a gRPC client interface, which uses protocol buffers.
